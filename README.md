MSU 2022 Individual Project - Commerce Website

# Project Summary
For Fall of 2022 at Montclair State, CSIT 355 requires its students to construct a website that demonstrates competency in the creation of back-end facilities that function with little to no error. This is normally a group project, but due to the fact that I had done a group project similar to this, I opted to do it independent since I still had source files available from the previous group assignement that I could use, as well as anything else I found that could help with implementation of the requirements - these are all credited in the documentation. 

I had chosen to make a website based off of an existing IP, since the project had required us to choose a character to base the project off of. 

The current look of the website is extremely basic, and not entirely polished, but this is due to the fact that most of the project was focused on having an operating backend - but I am providing files for the project so people can view them, or reference them if needed with links to sources, as well.
