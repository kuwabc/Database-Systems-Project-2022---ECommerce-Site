MSU 2022 Individual Project - Commerce Website

# Project Summary
For Fall of 2022 at Montclair State, CSIT 355 required its students to construct a website that demonstrates competency in the creation of back-end facilities that function with little to no error. This is normally a group project, but due to the fact that I had done a group project similar to this, I opted to do it independent since I still had these files, as well as anything else I found that could help with implementation of the requirements - these are all credited in the documentation. 

I had chosen to make a website based off of an existing IP, since the project had required us to choose a character to base the project off of. 

The current look of the website is extremely basic, and not entirely polished. Excluding this, the project was mainly focused on having an operating backend.

This was my first, more in-depth implementation/usage of PHP/MySQL - a deeper usage of it compared to the last project I was involved in that used some aspects of it.
So it will not look very polished since this would be my 2nd time in implementing it - However this is something I have learned to clean up on since then.
